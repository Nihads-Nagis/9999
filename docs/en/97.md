#### 97.1 Market Dynamics

Current compute demand is limited by energy and silicon cost; our approach replaces transistor scaling with optical utilization.

Adoption is driven by software efficiency and zero-install deployment.

Partners integrate through open repositories and mirrored infrastructure.

#### 97.2 Economic Model

**Core idea:**

Each ‚Äúboot‚Äù is a *frame-based activation* of the OS environment, injected and calibrated through the ‚ÄúZero Boot Utility.‚Äù

It replaces startup sequences with instant memory/frame loading ‚Äî effectively a **paid compute session** rather than a continuous OS runtime.

* **Device scope (initial):** Android (A/B partitioned devices easiest to target)
* **Frequency limit:** 1 boot/day (‚âà30/month cap)
* **Delivery:** Online license validation per device ID
* **Fallback:** Ad-watch credit for lower-income or test users
* **Monetization:** $1/month/device (‚âà$12/year) baseline, or $6/year prepaid

This isn‚Äôt SaaS. It‚Äôs *session-as-a-service.*

* No per-frame or per-boot billing.
* Open use of frame logic under transparent terms.
* Participating partners (e.g., Git, Cloudflare) benefit through traffic and usage expansion rather than license fees.
* Growth measured in logical throughput (frames processed, devices booted, comprehension cycles).

#### 97.3: Financial Model^*^:

The addressable global device base is measured not by population but by **screen presence**.

Every active GPU or display chip represents a potential logic node.

Emulation Credits Economy (Devs)

If each dev averages 200 boots/month and pays $0.002/boot after the first 30 free, you generate ~$4 M/yr from 100 k active devs ‚Äî a modest but steady income stream tied to usage.

* **Purpose:** Reward devs and testers for generating useful telemetry or training data during boots.
* **Mechanism:** 1 emulation = 1 frame session = 1 credit.
* **Redemption:** credits offset boot fees or convert into ad-free sessions.
* **Analytics cut:** system retains 10‚Äì15 % of telemetry data value as ‚Äúnetwork tax.‚Äù

  This lets you *earn from developer activity* ethically ‚Äî they still benefit from access and visibility.

##### Result: a self-balancing micro-economy.

#### 97.5 Operational Model

At the system‚Äôs root lies the **Light Operating Fabric** ‚Äî an orchestration layer that coordinates devices, frames, and comprehension models.

* Devices authenticate via their visual identity.
* Each boot sequence establishes a session of reasoning, not just runtime.
* Data transfer is conducted as light-encoded deltas; the same infrastructure supports storage, communication, and verification.
* Collaboration between users and machines occurs through mirrored repositories of frame logic.

This model transforms the entire ecosystem into a **living development organism** , where updates, discoveries, and reasoning are shared as light-state evolutions.


* 97.24 Roadmap

#### 97.6 Strategic Advantage

Immediate deployability, zero dependency on new manufacturing, and compatibility with any light-emitting device establish a defensible early-mover position in the post-silicon market.

#### 97.26: CAPM (added by AI)

**Github as Your R&D Department:** You don't hire researchers; you . You find the most talented, frustrated developers working on adjacent problems (e.g., LuxCore for rendering, specific GPU compute projects).

**analyze the sentiment and limitations** of thousands of developers on platforms like GitHub

The path isn't through traditional corporate R&D. It's through **orchestrating the global open-source ecosystem.**
