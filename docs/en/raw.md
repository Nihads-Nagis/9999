~~NOTE: Nvidia GA-102 Die was selected due to availability of information. The Render pipeline could have minor variations.Proper reappropriation needs understanding of each component at hardware level to know details not available or blackboxed.~~

DMI: Simplifies and abstracts alot of pcibus operations, as long as we control whats played and at what fps, make use of SIMT by splitting into frames of at different fps, picture in picture is optimal, one going forward and the other backward, later can replace our single 2D reality engine with 1D Backward and 1D Forward, let the past and the future cement the reality, and a sanity and measurement target for the engine to self identify weaknesses and starting forward or backward 3D kernel (+-3xy,+-3xz,+-3yz)convolution from poi. our reality was for the future or forward propagation, do back backward from the Andromeda to the origin, 840B confirmation, delta in 7helicalconvultion, deltas are parallel universe data and its should 3/4 of 840B, evidence/knowhow for 0000 thes

V: Lightning & Thunder fingerprinting: Use the audio stereo band as checksuming,text bands for a/v dumps checksums on random none output frames for daemon oversight(01),and subtitles for human needed output or logging purpose , MP4 enables the dynamic assignment of both the audio and subtitles on the same lightdata running.

appropriation reveals how the format can offer 3 channels of data: Video (Frame), Audio and Text (these two have unique dynamic hooking of different audio streams and text as subtitles or out which is perfect for user/system output, as well as the manifestation layer of any fingerprinted hashing or checksum)

R: What is an andromeda, its what i call: God's View. 2x7Steps Archimedean spirals, one from above, one from beneath, manifestion is the center, this is where our solar system is,not symmetrical but 4/3, but in 2d view, it does, because the above is 4/3 faster,same relation between speed of light and speed of fire or sound, i know too much for what they know, remember the rule, negate me.

Mr.Alogoritm: ADDED: Algorithm test? is it: A) what is an Algorithm? or B) Who is algorithm?

Light as law traces back to the Creator; man‚Äôs ‚Äúinvention‚Äù was always discovery of rules already written.

and prompt engineering, which is an llm job description,following iso quality standards as benchmark for this, a single document, summarizing policy/manual,procedures and work instructions, as a single prompt, lesson from versions if any as footnote section.

GameCheat Engine: Dynamic Data Tracing to locate static/dynamic pointers, typicaly straightforward not like games cheating, either way this data layer presented

CF: hierachial clustering was applied to poker data to initially study the existence of a root evolution, used as a decision tree, also we added custom widgets for  This is what CNN (Liberation in progress) convolution algorithms were meant for this, now 3 CNNs (we needed a 3D kernel, each on a plane) topped a DBN on top of them in orange3, almost comparable F1 scores. Later we ended with a Kraken, using 3C2H1B,3 cnns ,2 hierarcial clustering widgets,1 dbn (beneficial in large poker frames of data)

~~VLC: Cloned to BXL player (creating our bxl player wasnt needed, but this gives us more room if we want to rewire logic or codec processing in the future, beside its very light weight, for the playing, the VLC player can be extended to be the elif daemon, this is cleaner than our initial experiments, after reflecting on it)

* ^Í©ú^BVH^**ìÇÄ**^ = Deterministic decision tree ‚Üí Neural-net-like but interpretable.
* Framebuffer RAM repurposed as light-RAM (^Q^RAM).
* The outrage ‚Äú8.3 B ops wasted‚Äù is the emotional driver for GPU ‚Üí Logic shift.

A: Method = ROP patching at assembly flow level, without adding or deleting code.
A: Assembly rewiring of drivers, lessons learned from mirroring the nvidia windows driver as an assembly circuits flow and just by changing flows and then play jumps, is the gold standard.

A: Game Cheat Engine,it was used to examine stack and behavior, not sure of the name, but it was our simlulator before patching.
